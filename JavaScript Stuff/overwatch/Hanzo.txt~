<p>
Hanzo is a defensive hero that is great around at around-the-corner fighting. Hanzo's arrows
are a strong projectile, but they lack some accuracy, although skilled Hanzo players can negate this 
effect. Hanzo's Dragon Strike is powerful and can clear any stronghold, but often hard to build meter for.
Scatter arrow is a great way to kill enemies lodged in the corner or chasing Hanzo, but often feels
lackluster in the physics of the bouncing.
