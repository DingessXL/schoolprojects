<h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p> Here you'll find my personal tier list for competitive play.
            This is not a definitive list of competitive viability, but just my ranking for heroes
            based on reward and skill levels. Also keep in mind, that heroes have different viability
            and strengths depending on modes, attack/defend, and team composition.</p>
        <p>
            I hope you find it helpful when choosing a hero to both have fun, and
            get more wins. Good luck out there in the world, hero!
        </p>

        <p>
            I hope to make a UI to get you guys' input in the future and base
            this site's rankings on some group analysis.
        </p>
