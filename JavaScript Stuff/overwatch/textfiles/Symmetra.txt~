<p>
Symettra is a tempo hero, and allows your team to get back in the fray quicker
when killed. Symmetra excels at keeping the pressure up and defending early payload locations.
Symettra is great at defending backdoors to your team for heroes like Bastion and Torbjorn. Symmetra, however,
prefers not to fight herself, making her a less than stellar choice for teams on offense.
