<p>
Mei is the perfect champion on defense, preferring to wait on enemies to approach,
than to rush into the enemy lines. However, Mei's walls allow teams to get past opponents
with lots of defensive heroes, allowing for pushing into points by denying vision. Mei is also bulky
and can deal with both healthy and frail enemies with ease. Mei's Cryo-freeze allows Mei to be 
a little bit reckless while teammates catch up to her. Mei's ultimate is the best ability in the game when
it comes to defending a point by herself, often catching whole teams by surprise.
