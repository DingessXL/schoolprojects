<p>
Bastion is easy to excel at as long as you know the map well. Bastion's high rate of fire,
ammo/clip, and bullet damage make him an exceptional choice to defense teams. Bastion suffers from
a need for the enemy to come to him, however, and when on the attack can easily be dealt with.
Bastion can however, set up on a payload and be an unstoppable force when combined with support from
a good shield.
