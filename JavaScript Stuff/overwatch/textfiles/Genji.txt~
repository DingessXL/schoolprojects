Mercy is an easy hero to play, but difficult to master. Mercy requires a good sense of your teams position and status to use
correctly. Her ultimate will revive your team's dead members in place, meaning a good Mercy ult can swing the game in an instant
by keeping control of any objective. Mercy builds her meter easily and safely, assuming you are with your teammates, and is a reliable support
with amazing one-target sustain (as well as herself).
