<p>
DVA's bulk and infinite ammo can prove to be difficult to deal with, as well as 
dealing with her twice before she's actually defeated. DVA is great against teams with multiple explosive users,
as she destroyes those projectiles with her Defense Array. DVA's ult has incredible damage 
and range and when used correctly will not fail to clear objectives and groups of enemies.
