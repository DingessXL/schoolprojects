Zarya feels almost like a hybrid offense and tank hero. She often feels like an off-tank, and
needs a good team composition to fully succeed. Zarya combines a lot of elements of other heroes in
a unique way, but also suffers from the pitfalls of those heroes as well. Zarya does decent damage with her laser
beam and excellent damage with her barrage of explosions. Zarya's ultimate is most 
devastating in one scenario: The enemy team is grouped on an objective.</p>
