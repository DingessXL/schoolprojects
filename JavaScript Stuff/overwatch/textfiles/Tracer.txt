Tracer's mobility is unparalleled in Overwatch. Killing a good Tracer can prove to be a challenge for even the best teams,
since fights occur only when she wants them to. Disrupting the enemy back-line and decimating groups with her ultimate are
some of her specialties. Anyone not fast enough to keep up will be left in the dust.
