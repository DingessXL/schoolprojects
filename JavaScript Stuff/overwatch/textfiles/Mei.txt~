Genji excels at disrupting the backline of a team. Genji's throwing stars have great damage and good versatility for
both long range and short range combat. Being able to reflect projectiles is an amazing ability for both defense and offense.
Genji's ult is a little lackluster for S tier, but if Genji didn't have an ultimate 
at all, he would still make the tier. Being able to close in and melee, and dash away from bad fights
make Genji an excellent hero on both offense and defense.
