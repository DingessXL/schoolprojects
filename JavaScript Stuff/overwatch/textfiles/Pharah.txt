Pharah is an exceptional choice when your opponents like to group up. Pharah's explosives
allow her to hit elusive enemies with splash damage and big enemies with heavy direct damage.
Pharah is somewhat slow though, and suffers from vulnerability when she "lets justice rain from above."
Getting direct hits on squihsy targets will decimate them, although good players will dodge direct hits with ease.
