<p>
Junkrat has an uncanny ability to stay safe while dealing massive damage to enemy heroes.
His bouncing explosives can make short work of tanky immobile units, and a direct hit from
them will cause any squishy target to feel the pain. High burst damage and displacement from
his mine makes Junkrat incredible at point defense and getting people away from a payload. Junkrat's ultimate
is able to be dealt with, but Junkrat can be safe while using it. Junkrat's "martyrdom" will keeps enemies at bay 
when controlling points, and can get some tricky kills versus forgetful enemies.
