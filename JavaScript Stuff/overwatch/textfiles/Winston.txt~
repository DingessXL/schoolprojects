<p>
Winston is the most mobile of the tanks and excels at running down offensive heroes,
who can't out speed him. His shield is good for point capture and defense, but lacks the durability to be
considered an amazing ability. Inching forward on offense often feels slow, but defending payloads and their destinations 
is a good show of Winston at his best.
His ultimate, however, often feels bad to use because knocking away opponents can give
them an oppurtunity to escape his clutches and live to fight another day.
