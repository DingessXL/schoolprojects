Reaper's handcannon's will destroy anyone that gets in his way, often killing targets in less than a second. Reaper can infilitrate
the backline of the enemy with his teleport, but also alerts the enemy in doing so. Becoming impervious to bullets for a short time
is a decent defensive ability, but shouldn't be used to close in on many heroes, as they are already
set up to blast him when he becomes tangible again. Reapers ult is easily canceled and the 
sound queue for it allows the enemy to react in no time at all. Killing targets from far away is near impossible 
for Reaper.
