<p>
McCree is an offensive hero that excels at killing squishy targets by stunning them and 
unloading into their guts. Good McCree players will take full advantage of rolling to reload,
and release several volleys of bullets into enemy heroes. McCree's revolver is also a decent sniper rifle.
McCree, however, suffers from the need for pinpoint accuracy, and high mobility characters will prove difficult to handle.
McCree also lacks defensive mechanics, and needs good support to be a big threat.
