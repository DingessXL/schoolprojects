<p>
Reinhardt has, undeniably, the best shield in the game. It's high durability and large surface area
keeps your team safe for a long time. Reinhardt can pair with a number of heroes to become an unstoppable force.
Reinhardt's utility is great on both offense and defense. Reinhardt is also great at killing other tanks with his charge
and can easily dispatch groups of enemies with his ult. Clubbing enemies to death with high melee 
damage is oh-so satisfying.
