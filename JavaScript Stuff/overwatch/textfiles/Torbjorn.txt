<p>
Torbjorn is always a great choice on defense. Torbjorn's turret, when place in the right spot, 
will dispatch enemies automatically and with ease, while Torbjorn presents a decent amount of 
shielding to his teammates. Torbjorn suffers from a unique lack of offensive ability, and is probably the worst 
character to play on offense. This is balanced with an incredible defensive strength.
