<p>
Lucio is an interesting support choice, because he builds meter passively and quickly when in the vacinity
of teammates, making his ultimate useful quite a lot in a single game or match. Lucio's knockback is good for self-defense 
and being hit by a triple hit is a decent amount of damage. Lucio's ultimate is great for keeping control of objectives.
Lucio's gameplay is somewhat linear, but is useful on any team.
